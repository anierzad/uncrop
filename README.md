# Image Uncrop

I have many images which a long time ago I cropped and resized for a forum thread. I now wish to migrate the forum thread to my blog however the images are quite small by todays standards so I'd like to resize them. While I do have all the original images I don't have the cropped images, prior to resizing.

## Challenges

	* Finding a quick and reliable way to compare two images to see if they are similar
	* Dealing with JPEG compression causing images to differ
	* Avoiding false matches
